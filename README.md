GoSIPs
======
Go SIP Stack will be updated

The objective of GoSIPs is to develop a Golang stack interface and implementation to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that can be used independently or by higher level programming entities and environments.


GoSIPs is still in heavy development stage. Currently, SIP Message Parser/Encoder is almost done, but it still need more polish and torture-test.
